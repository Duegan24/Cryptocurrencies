# Cryptocurrencies

## Background

### Purpose
This project was focused on taking an example dataset of cryptocurrencies that included a couple of key facts such as the algorithm that was used to generate the cryptocurrency and the total coins mined.  This information was then evaluated using an unsupervised machine learning model to determine how the various currencies were clustered.  Those clusters were then displayed visually to give a better understanding of how the various clusters compared to each other.  

A key aspect of the task was to ensure that the data was properly scaled.  Additionally, principle component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the number of variables to make the analysis more efficient.  Ultimately it was determine using an elbow curve the best number of clusters and the final analysis was presented for evaluation.
